# ðŸ”§ Learning n8n â€“ Automation Experiments

Hi! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository is a collection of small experiments and workflows I'm building as I learn **[n8n](https://n8n.io/)** â€“ a powerful workflow automation tool.

## ðŸš€ What This Is

I'm currently exploring how to automate tasks using n8n, connect APIs, and build simple bots and tools â€” including Telegram bots, Google Sheets integrations, and public API workflows.

This is a learning project, and things may change or break as I experiment and improve my understanding.
